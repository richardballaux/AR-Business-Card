# AR-Business-Card

This repository contains the Augmented Reality overlay of my personal business card.

## How does the user experience work

On the business card a QR-code is present. When the QR code is scanned by the native camera app or a QR scanner-app by a mobile phone, this opens the main page of the hosted website.
The [webpage](https://richardballaux.github.io/AR-Business-Card/) will ask for camera access and when granted, the business card augmented reality overlay will appear.

A demo can be found [here](https://youtu.be/VKTLNFiDXvw).

## Code explanation

It uses AR.js, which is built on top of aframe.js.
